# Mangrove Location Bot

A bot that talks to Mangrove members on Slack to update their current location.
See members locations at meetmangrove.com/team

The bot will ping all slack members to ask them if the 'Current Location' we have in Airtable is still valid. If not, user will have the opportunity to update it.

Users can also proactively update their location simply by talking 1:1 to @sally-ride. It offers the 3 following actions:

`!map`: returns the URL of the map  
`!myloc`: returns the current location we have in Airtable  
`!newloc <address>`: updates user's current location to found <City, Country> from address given. Will ask to confirm the found <City, Country> is correct. If multiple pairs are found, the user will be able to choose.
